# How To Wire Size

## Formula

`(Amperes × Wire Length) / (Voltage × % Voltage Drop)`

## Sizing a wire for solar panel to MPPT connection

> Get the solar panel `Imp` spec for `Ampere` value
>
> Get the solar panel `Vmp` spec for `Voltage` value
>
> If we have two solar panels in series
> (8.90A x 49ft) / (44.96V x % 2) = 436 / 89.9 = 4.8 VDI
